# RESTful-Note-App
A simple experimental application to practice RESTful routing

In case, you saw this repo accidentally and too eager to see what the shi$$y app I made
look into package.json(or just look down :p) for dependencies and install via **NPM**
and then run it in Node.js environment.

### Stuff used in this app
  - Express Framework
  - Mongodb
  - Bootstrap
  - CKEDITOR plugin

### Install dependencies
```npm install express ejs mongoose body-parser method-override express-sanitizer --save ```

<strong>One last thing, before running this app install mongodb in your workspace (mongoose alone won't help) and keep mongod running</strong>
